# Puniko Software License Collection

Welcome to the Puniko Software License Collection repository. This repository contains a collection of unique software licenses created by Jeffrey Skinner, also known as Jeffrey-sama.

The licenses in this repository reflect the founder's philosophy of the power of code and the importance of respecting the software's authorship. Each license is crafted with care, containing haikus that add an artistic and thoughtful touch to the legal language.

If you are a developer who is interested in using one of Puniko's licenses for your software, please carefully read and understand the terms of the license before use. The terms are designed to protect the author's work and provide guidelines for usage.

Remember that Puniko licenses prohibit sharing, selling, or leasing the software, and any alterations must receive the author's permission. The licenses provide clear guidance on how to properly use the software and the consequences of misuse.

We hope that the Puniko Software License Collection repository and its unique licenses can inspire and guide you on your own software development journey.
